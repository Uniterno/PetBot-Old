# PetBot-Old
Old, unmaintained code for Discord bot PetBot, written in JavaScript, for personal usage only.

**All the code here was built for personal usage only, in the span of around 3 years, only by me, and has different layers of knowledge, all built upon the old code. This means that there's a lot of old and ugly code, mixed with some decent code, and mixed with some code I'm a bit proud of. Barely commented as it was a personal project, now that I'm making it public I regret it a bit, but can't change the past.**

Reminder: This bot was never made public, it was for my own server only, so the requirements were lower. There's a lot of things I wouldn't have done the way they are for actual projects.
